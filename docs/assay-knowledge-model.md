# ASSAY — Knowledge Model

**Founding doc 2** · LinkML schema + commentary
Status: draft for review · v0.2 · 2026-07-12 · DEC-16 confidence → band-width mapping decided in research note `01-knowledge.md` (relative-width floor; §3 Provenance)
Authority: ASSAY-DEC-3 (independent schema), DEC-6 (knowledge object as central type), DEC-9/15 (banded honesty; pure intervals), DEC-14 (fact/assessment split), DEC-16 (ICD 203 confidence enum), DEC-17 (embedded question; lifecycle; scenario clock), DEC-18 (expected-answer-per-COA), DEC-19 (commitment tiers), DEC-20 (plan shape), DEC-21 (two-tier identity).
Companions: `assay-seam-contract.md` (how these shapes move), `assay-vignette.md` (the Meridian instances K1–K14, C1–C6, R1–R3).

This document is the source of truth for every data shape in ASSAY. TypeScript types are generated from the LinkML schema in §11 (SPEC-03), never hand-drifted. Commentary sections are normative where they state invariants and refusal behaviour; the schema and the commentary are maintained together — a change to one without the other is a defect.

---

## 1. Principles, restated as schema decisions

1. **Assessment is never a scalar.** Any value whose provenance is `reported`, `assessed`, or `assumption` is carried as a `Band` — a closed interval `{lo, hi, unit}` with no stored midpoint and no distributional claim (DEC-15). Only `observed` values (fact, narrowly defined: charted, surveyed, own-force — never inferred) and commander's directive thresholds (fact-of-intent) may be scalar (DEC-14).
2. **The question is the object.** A KnowledgeObject exists from the moment a JIPOE question is posed, before any answer exists (DEC-17). Collection queues, discrimination rankings, and exposure views are lifecycle views of one type, not joins across several.
3. **Relationships are edges, not fields.** Supersession, contestation, resolution, waiver-of, compiled-into: all are TraceEdges written at the moment the relationship is created (DEC-21, constitution III). Classes carry no `supersedes`/`superseded_by` slots — the graph is the single home of history.
4. **Time is scenario time.** All windows, forecasts, routes, and task times are expressed in scenario-clock timesteps (D-day origin). Wall-clock time appears only in the delta feed envelope, which is not content-addressed and feeds no computation (DEC-17; seam G1).
5. **Everything stored is immutable and content-addressed.** Two-tier identity: a stable `logical_id` (`K9`, `C2`, `R1`, `P3`) names the thing; a content hash names each version of it (DEC-21, §2).

## 2. Identity, versioning, canonical form

Every stored object carries:

- `logical_id` — short, stable, human-assigned (`K1`…, `C1`…, `R1`…, `P`n, `W`n). Never reused, never changed across versions.
- `version` — integer, 1-origin, incremented on supersession within a lineage.
- `content_hash` — SHA-256 over the object's **canonical JSON**, computed at `PUT`, and the object's address in the store. Not a field of the hashed payload.

Canonical JSON (normative for SPEC-01; pitfalls are Stage-0 research): UTF-8; object keys sorted lexicographically; no insignificant whitespace; numbers serialised in shortest round-trip decimal form; no `NaN`/`Infinity`; optional absent slots omitted entirely (never `null`).

Revision is supersession: a new object version is `PUT`, and a `supersedes` TraceEdge is written from the new version's hash to the old. Cross-lineage supersession is legal and meaningful — in Meridian, `K9` (a fresh forecast) supersedes `K5` (the expiring one) — the edge carries the relationship whether or not logical ids match. Mutation does not exist; deletion does not exist (retirement is a lifecycle status).

## 3. Primitives

### Band (DEC-15)

`{lo: float, hi: float, unit: string}` — a closed interval, `lo ≤ hi`. **No midpoint slot exists and none may be added**; any code needing a representative point is making a banded-honesty error by construction. Scoring propagates intervals (worst-and-best case within band); dominance, verdicts, and rankings are computed in banded space only. A degenerate band (`lo == hi`) is legal and is how an `observed` value is carried when it flows through banded machinery.

### Provenance (DEC-14, DEC-16)

`{source_class, confidence, owner, single_source, collected_at, note}`.

- `source_class`: `observed | reported | assessed | assumption`. `observed` is fact — directly charted, surveyed, or own-force, never inferred — and is the only class that may render unbanded. Everything else is banded and carries the "assessment, not fact" marking on every surface (constitution II).
- `confidence`: `low | moderate | high` — ICD 203's confidence levels, fixed now. The confidence → band-width mapping DEC-16 deferred is **decided in research note `01-knowledge.md`**: a minimum relative width per level (`low ≥ 0.25, moderate ≥ 0.10, high ≥ 0`, with `r = (hi−lo)/max(|lo|,|hi|)` — no midpoint, DEC-15-safe), enforced at `POST /knowledge` as a warning-level lint (`observed` exempt). It enters the schema as an `annotations:` note on `ConfidenceBand` — a metadata annotation, not a shape change — under SPEC-05.
- `single_source: boolean` — set when corroboration is absent; drives the deception flag in sensitivity ranking (thesis E). Mandatory rendering wherever the value renders.
- `owner` — the accountable analyst/staff cell. Trace chains terminate in named owners (constitution III).
- `collected_at` — scenario timestep of collection/observation.

### Scenario clock

`timestep: integer ≥ 0`, D-day origin. The vignette fixes the calibration (Meridian: 6-hour steps, horizon D+14 = 56 steps). `ValidityWindow {valid_from, valid_until}` is compared against the *world's* scenario clock at compile/score time — never against wall clock (DEC-17).

## 4. KnowledgeObject (DEC-6, DEC-17, DEC-18)

The central type: one quantified JIPOE Q&A, whole-life.

| Slot | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `question` | string, required | The JIPOE question, doctrinally shaped ("What is the load capacity of the Ledger causeway?") |
| `subject` | string, required | What the answer informs — a compile channel or topic key (`mobility.causeway`, `threat.battery`, `scenario.likelihood`) |
| `encoding_class` | enum, required | `hard_constraint | banded_soft_cost | scenario_weight` — how the answer is *allowed* to enter the compile (§9) |
| `answer` | Band, optional | Absent while `status = open`. Banded always; degenerate band for `observed` |
| `provenance` | Provenance | Required once `answer` present |
| `criticality` | `routine | important | critical` | J-2's judgement of how much rides on the question |
| `validity` | ValidityWindow, optional | Perishable answers (forecasts) carry one; expiry against scenario clock ⇒ `stale` |
| `status` | LifecycleStatus | `open → answered → (superseded | stale | contested) → resolved | retired` (DEC-17) |
| `waiver` | Waiver, optional | Required for an assessed/reported source claiming `hard_constraint` (§9); `{granted_by, justification, granted_at}` |
| `expected_answers` | ExpectedAnswer[], optional | The miniature event matrix (DEC-18): per ScenarioCOA, the band the answer is expected to fall in if that COA is the truth. Meaningful for `open` questions; retained after answering for audit |
| `collection` | CollectionOption[], optional | For open questions: `{method, cost: Band, earliest_result: timestep}` — cost is an estimate, therefore banded |

**Lifecycle (normative).** `open`: posed, unanswered — ranked by discrimination (from `expected_answers` separation) and carried in S1's collect queue. `answered`: answer + provenance present. `superseded`: a `supersedes` edge points at this version; the superseding object identifies exactly the verdicts this version fed (thesis F is a trace walk from here). `stale`: validity window expired on the scenario clock, or superseded. `contested`: a `contests` edge links two live objects answering the same question — **neither may compile** (G5) until a `resolves` edge lands. `resolved`: contest closed with a surviving answer. `retired`: withdrawn from use by owner decision, without replacement.

**Discrimination (DEC-18).** The discrimination value of an open question is a function of the separation between its `expected_answers` bands across the live COA set — disjoint bands discriminate; nested or overlapping bands don't. `/analyse/discrimination` computes this; nothing stores it (it changes whenever the COA set or bands change).

## 5. Commitment (DEC-19)

A commander-owned condition a plan is held to. `{statement, tier, metric, comparator, threshold, unit, owner, scope}`.

- `statement` — command language, verbatim ("Halcyon Strait open to deep-draught traffic by D+7"). This is what surfaces render; the typed slots below are its machine form.
- `tier` — `must | should | prefer` (DEC-19). Ordinal only; **no numeric weight slot exists**. Relaxation sacrifices from the bottom tier up; within-tier ties are broken explicitly in the RelaxationReport, never silently.
- `metric`, `comparator` (`at_most | at_least | by_step | never`), `threshold`, `unit` — the testable predicate over a scored plan/world. `threshold` is scalar by design: a directive is fact-of-intent, not an assessment (DEC-14). Where a commitment references an assessed quantity, it references the *channel* (which is banded), not a private copy of the number.
- Verdicts against commitments are computed objects (§8), never fields of the commitment.

## 6. ScenarioCOA

One adversary course of action, held as a first-class scenario. `{name, narrative, excursion, likelihood}`.

- `narrative` — the red COA statement in doctrinal form (situation-template prose).
- `excursion` — how this COA perturbs the compiled world: a list of `ChannelOverride {channel, region?, override: Band}` applied at compile time. A COA is a *world variant*, not a special case in the scorer (DEC-10 keeps the scorer scenario-blind: it scores plan × world × scenario by being handed the excursion world).
- `likelihood` — a reference (logical id) to a KnowledgeObject whose `encoding_class = scenario_weight`. The likelihood of a COA is an assessment like any other: banded, provenanced, contestable, supersedable. **Firewall (§9): it may weight attention and reporting, and never compiles into a constraint or cost.**
- Indicators live on the questions, not the COA: any open KnowledgeObject whose `expected_answers` separate this COA from another is an indicator for the pair (DEC-18).

## 7. CompiledWorld, Plan, ForceElement

**CompiledWorld** — the deterministic product of compile (DEC-5): `{grid, channels, consumed, scenario, engine_version, stamp}`.

- `grid` — `{cols, rows, cell_km, timestep_hours, horizon_steps}` (Meridian: 60×60, 2 km, 6 h, 56).
- `channels` — named layers (`mobility`, `tide`, `storm`, `civil_density`, `sensor`, `threat`), each stored **sparse**: a `default: Band` plus a set of `RegionOverride {region, value: Band, from_step?, until_step?, source?}` — named, optionally time-boxed deviations from the default, the MCOO idiom (research note `02-compile.md`; **retires the dense `{x, y, t, value}` cell array**, resolving seam open item 2). Channel values are banded because their sources are; an override built solely from `observed` inputs carries a degenerate band; `source` names the KnowledgeObject the value derives from (G3). Region→cell geometry lives once in the **VignetteConfig** (`{grid, channels: ChannelDefault[], regions: RegionGeometry[], subject_map: SubjectMapEntry[]}`), never per world; region→cell materialisation is a lazy, unstored, score-time function — no dense per-cell channel is ever stored or hashed.
- `consumed` — the exact set of `{logical_id, content_hash}` knowledge versions the compile read (sorted, so the stamp is order-independent). The `stamp` is a hash over `consumed` + vignette config + engine version (+ any scenario excursion): same knowledge set ⇒ byte-identical stamp (G1) — the stamp is over *inputs*, never over materialised cells. `compiled_into` edges are written per consumed object at compile time.

**Plan** (DEC-20) — `{name, seed, generator, elements: ElementPlan[]}`; `ElementPlan {force_element, route: RouteLeg[], tasks: TaskWindow[]}`; `RouteLeg {x, y, enter_step, exit_step}`; `TaskWindow {task, x, y, from_step, until_step}`. Nothing richer: no inter-element dependencies, no abstract action language in v1.

**ForceElement** — vignette-owned: `{name, kind, mobility_class, notes}`.

## 8. Computed artefacts: verdicts, scores, rationale

All computed objects are stored, content-addressed, and stamped; each is written together with the trace edges that justify it (constitution III).

- **CommitmentVerdict** — `{plan, commitment, scenario, world_stamp, verdict, margin, engine_version}`. `verdict` is the four-stop scale `robust | marginal | tight | violated` — no decimals anywhere; `margin` is a Band shown only on demand (hover), never as a headline number.
- **PlanScore** — `{plan, scenario, world_stamp, criterion, score: Band}`. Dominance between plans is judged over these bands (banded non-domination), per scenario and across the scenario set (thesis C).
- **RelaxationReport** (G4) — `{world_stamp, scenario, candidates: RelaxationCandidate[], tie_break}`. Each `RelaxationCandidate {plan, sacrificed: Commitment-refs (non-empty), narrative}` states its sacrifice in command language ("opens the strait D+9, two days late"). An infeasible commitment set returns candidates with `sacrificed` populated — never an empty set, never a silent constraint drop. `tie_break` is required prose whenever two same-tier sacrifices were ordered (DEC-19).
- **SelectionRationale** — `{selected_plan, relaxation_report, statement, decided_by}`. The commander's act, recorded; its arrival re-prioritises verification of the knowledge under the decision (exposure view).

## 9. Encoding discipline (normative — the compile firewall)

How an answer may enter the compiled world is a function of `encoding_class` × `source_class`:

| | `observed` | `reported` / `assessed` | `assumption` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hard_constraint` | compiles | **waiver required** — refused as `waiver_required` without one; with one, compiles and the waiver renders wherever the constraint bites | refused (`encoding_violation`) |
| `banded_soft_cost` | compiles (degenerate band) | compiles, banded | compiles, banded, `assumption` marking mandatory |
| `scenario_weight` | — (a weight is never observed) | **never compiles into constraint or cost by any path** — weights order attention and reporting only | same |

Plus, regardless of class: `contested` never compiles (G5, refusal `contested_knowledge`); `stale` never compiles silently (refusal `stale_input`; recompiling past staleness is an explicit human act of re-validation or supersession). Meridian exercises every refusal row (K10, K8, K12, K5 respectively).

## 10. TraceEdge (DEC-5, DEC-21)

`{from_hash, to_hash, edge_type, stamp?, written_by}` with `edge_type`:

| Edge | From → To | Written by / when |
|---|---|---|
| `compiled_into` | KnowledgeObject → CompiledWorld channel | compile, per consumed object |
| `scored_from` | CompiledWorld / Plan / ScenarioCOA → CommitmentVerdict / PlanScore | scorer, per output |
| `cited_in` | CommitmentVerdict / PlanScore → RelaxationReport / SelectionRationale | relax / selection |
| `sacrificed_in` | Commitment → RelaxationCandidate | relax |
| `supersedes` | new version → old version | knowledge service, on supersede |
| `contests` | KnowledgeObject ↔ KnowledgeObject | knowledge service, on contest |
| `resolves` | resolving object → contested pair | knowledge service, on resolve |
| `waives` | Waiver-carrying object → the constraint use it licenses | compile |

Edges are written at compute time by the service performing the computation, never reconstructed after the fact. Every computed artefact must be backward-walkable to named KnowledgeObjects with named owners; a dead-end chain is a defect that surfaces as a visible error (constitution III). Forward walks from a knowledge object are the exposure and staleness views (theses E/F).

## 12. Deliberate absences (register-backed)

- **No midpoint, no distribution parameters** on Band (DEC-15).
- **No numeric commitment weights** (DEC-19).
- **No `supersedes`/`contests` slots** on classes — edges only (DEC-21).
- **No wall-clock fields** on stored objects (DEC-17; G1). The delta feed's display time lives in the event envelope (seam contract §10), outside content addressing.
- **No REMIT imports** of any kind (DEC-3). Convergence findings go back as REMIT register candidates.
- **No PMESII node-link classes** — thesis G is horizon (concept §1); admitting shapes for it now would be false-precision risk with no consumer.

Open items for a future register batch: whether `criticality` earns its keep once discrimination/sensitivity rankings exist (it may be redundant with computed priority); whether `ExpectedAnswer` needs a provenance of its own (who says the COA would look like that?).
